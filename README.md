### Genesis_scripts: 
is a project to automate some tasks during the daily work.</br> The <b>inspecta_result.pl</b> calculates an avarage offset for x/y axis meassured on Inspecta Roentgen Machine for each multilayer panel. </br> The <b>aoiProfile7.pl</b> is a subproces for a c-shell AOI-script which simplify the outline for a better recognizing of non-of-interest fields for AOI machine.    

### myPerlProject: 
Is my very first step into the perl scripting, which has to find-replace some special coordinates in the excellon output file for drill machines. The script moves testing holes by the X/Y-offset in a drill file. If successed then a new file named '*-out' will be created.

### myXalOra: 
in this project I use the abbility to connect to the <b>ORACLE (v8.0)</b> database to fetch some data for the PriForm script.
