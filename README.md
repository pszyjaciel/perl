# perl

Genesis_scripts
is a project to automate some tasks during the daily work. The inspecta_result.pl calculates an avarage offset for x/y axis meassured on Inspecta Roentgen Machine for each multilayer panel. The aoiProfile7.pl is a subproces for a c-shell AOI-script which simplify the outline for a better recognizing of non-of-interest fields for AOI machine.    

myPerlProject 
Is my very first step into the perl scripting, which has to find-replace some special coordinates in the excellon output file for drill machines. The script moves testing holes by the X/Y-offset in a drill file. If successed then a new file named '*-out' will be created.

myXalOra 
in this project I use the abbility to connect to the ORACLE (v8.0) database to fetch some data for the PriForm script.
